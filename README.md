### Hi there! I'm Clare, and this is my GitHub profile 👋🏻
##### 👩🏻‍💻  I'm a full-stack software developer with an enthusiastic curiosity, strong empathy, and the desire to use clean code to solve human-centered problems. I bring with me a background in arts management and theatre, which has given me a knack for creativity, collaboration, and dependability. I look forward to continuing to use and grow these skills as a software developer. 

##### 🧰 I use: Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS | Frameworks/Libraries: React, Express, Node | Databases: PostgreSQL, Supabase | Tools: Git, Slack, GitHub, Netlify, Heroku, VSCode | Dev Practices: TDD, Pair and Mob Programming
##### 🌱  I’m currently learning at Alchemy Code Lab.
##### 🌙  Pronouns: she/her
##### 🎭  Fun fact: I love theatre and cats.
